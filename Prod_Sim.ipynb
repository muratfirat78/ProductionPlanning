    "In this production planning dashboard, we consider three basic sets of objects; product, resources, and operations. A product is an output of an activity, so-called operation, that consumes certain capacity of the specified resource. A product has a set of predecessors that should be ready to start the operation of it. Every product and its predecessor relation is specified with a multiplier such that so many predecessors are needed to produce one of the product. For example, one simple electronic card may need four screws and one microcontroller to be assembled. Here, this electronic card has two predcessors; screw and microcontroller with multipliers four and one respectively. Note that if a product has no predecessor, then it is a raw material. Every raw material in our problem has an initial stock level and they are consumed in required amounts when the successor products start being produced. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Resources are in two types, machines and operators. The machines are used when the operation is not convenient for humans due to several reasons like working temperature (e.g. more than 50 degrees), hardness of the operation (e.g. metal cutting), scale and high precision of the operation (e.g. in nanometers), and so on. The human operators are more used for assembly and test operations where both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the output needs to be evaluated. An operation takes certain time to execute by a resource and it is in unit either machine-hour or man-hour. A customer order speficies the product in demand, the required quantity, and the desired date for the delivery of the products. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the production planning is to determine how much (time-dependent) capacity of every resource is consumed to complete the customer orders on time and how many raw materials are necessary for the operations.\n",

    "There are seven input files in csv format to provide the problem intances of the production planning. Four files include information about the  objects; products, resources, operations, and customer orders. Three files include the relational information between products (precedence relations), product-operation links (which operation is required to produce a product), and resource-operation links (which resource is required to conduct an operation).

    "Customer Orders represent customer demand and the required quantity of products should be produced, ideally, by their deadline. There may be some delay in deliveries of customer orders due to capacity levels of resources. Delivering a customer order on a date brings a required capacity use of resources on different days depending on the predecessors of the desired product. Production planning is determining a delivery date for every customer order that is feasible with resource capacities and stock levels of raw materials. In our problem, we assume that raw materials can always be purchased by any amount which makes our problem easier than the real-life challenges of production planning. Several methods are used to find best production planning given a production system properties and a set of customer orders. In this assignment, you are asked to implement a baseline heuristic algortihm that will be described on a runnnig example in the following section.   \n",

    "<font size =\"4\" color='red'> *A running example: Simple Flow Shop* </font><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple flow shop includes products that are in sequential precedence relations, as seen in the figure below. The set of all products that are needed to produce a final product is called the \"Bill of Material\", shrotly BOM, of that product. In our flow shop example below, we see the BOMs of products 3 and 4. The BOM of each product has raw material and an intermediate product. Note that the BOMs of products may be more complicated as more than one raw materials and intermediate product may be involved.  \n",

In our assignment we assume all multipliers are 1 in the product BOMs, that means one predecessor is required to produce one successor product. This should not be confused with having more than one predecessors. One product may have several predecessors, but one of each predecessor should be available to start the operation of the product.\n",

    "In the above figure we see the resources with their daily capacities in machine-hour and customer orders with their final product, quantity and deadlines. In this assignment, we assume that all resources are machine types and all operations only require one resource. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning Order 1 with a delivery on its deadline requires capacity use 20 machine-hours in Resource 3 till 16 March 2025 (Assume that the delivery is on the next day after the production of the desired quantity is completed). Since we cannot use any resource more than daily capacity, we allocate 20 machine-hours as 16 and 4 to days 15 and 16 March. Following the BOM of Product 3, for Order 1, we need to have 50 Product1 ready by the end of 14 March which requires 25 machine-hours from Resource 1 which is allocated as [16,9] to days 13-14 March. We assume one day jump is necessary between productions in the BOM due to inventory and transportation purposes. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding Order 3, with a delivery on its deadline requires capacity use 96 machine-hours till 24 March 2025. We allocate 96 machine-hours as [16,16,16,16,16,16] to days 19-24 March. Following the BOM of Product 3, for Order 3, we need to have 240 Product1 ready by the end of 18 March. This requires 120 machine-hours from Resource 1 which is allocated as [16,16,16,16,16,16,16,8] to days 11-18 March. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning of Order1 and Order3 in the above way without any delay results in the required (cumulative) capacity levels in the left chart of the following figure.  However, there is a feasibility problem in resource capacities from 14th March on (highlighted in red circle), hence this requires delaying Order 3, as Order 1 has sooner deadline, by some days. Delaying one day will alleviate the infeasiblity problem results in required (cumulative) capacities in the right chart.   \n",

    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement s baseline planning procedure. Orders have priorities due to their deadlines; i.e. the customer order with soonest deadline must be planned first. The primary goal is to plan customer orders without minumum delay. You will determine the delivery dates of customer orders starting from the one with earliest deadline and continue with the other with next-earliest deadline, and so on. For each customer order, you will determine the required (cumulative) capacity use by following the BOMs of the final product backwards as we have shown in the running example of simple flow shop. When an infeasibility in capacity level of any resource is encountered, then you will try to recover to the feasible case by delaying the order delivery date, increnetally in one day steps. Once a delay of certain days brings a feasible required capacity use, then you will continue planning in the BOM till all raw materials are reached. Then the requires stock levels of raw materials are determined, as we have shown in the running example. <br>   \n",

    "\n",
    "The planning of customer orders will also require stock levels of raw materials. \n",
    "Every raw material can be purchased at most certain amount in every week. The required raw material levels of planned customer orders should be feasible by possibly purchasing additional amount of raw materials for every week. \n"
